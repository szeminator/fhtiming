      <p>
        Course evaluation provides a visual representation of the time data of runners, riders and cyclists. 
        Charts and tables allow you to easily track and compare the performance of each participant. 
        This enables effective analysis and improves understanding of race conditions. And the flexible split number allows you to compare performance in different sections of the course.
