# FHtiming

This project is a Vue.js application that visualizes data using a bar chart. The data represents the progress of participants in a race, showing how many participants reached each stage of the race (start, turn1, turn2, finish).

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: The application uses Chart.js to visualize data in a bar chart format. Each bar represents a stage of the race, and the height of the bar represents the number of participants that reached that stage.
- **Responsive Design**: The chart is responsive and adjusts its size based on the size of its parent div, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Vue.js**: The application is built using Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the application: `npm run serve`

## Usage
